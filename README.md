# Traffic_signal_detecter
Final Project 2: 
Design a classifier to recognize traffic signs. 
(1) collect 300 images of stop sign, 300 images of pedestrain sign, 300 images of speed limit, 300 images of construction, 300 images of traffic light sign, 300 images of yield sign. 
(2) design feasures for your images (intensity, mean, variance, histogram of oriented gradient, .etc)
(3) Use 200 images of each class to train the model(SVM, Neural Network, or others) on feasures. 
(4) Use 100 images of each class to validate your model. 
(5) compute the training error and validation error and based on the accuracy, you probably adjust parameters of your selected model, add feasures and increase the size of training set.  
(6) I will test your algorithm on my testing data set
